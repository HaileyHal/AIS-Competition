Main Idea:
- create an evaluator for existing and proposed datacenters to score how sustainable they are. 
- it gives a score on how sustainable a proposed data center is, based on different variables (grid capacity, water use, local environment impact)
- provide suggestions to improve a score?


Questions for product:
- create a model of some kind, or have some other kind of logic to score?
- need to research most important categories for sustainability
- does an evaluator like this already exist?
